# Deno Oak starter project with Prettier/ESLint config

I made this repo for myself to add some basic linting while playing around with Deno. It'll probably be a while till Deno gets good linting support, so this brings me some sanity. 

Requires VSC Plugin: https://github.com/justjavac/typescript-deno-plugin

## Usage

    yarn
    deno run --allow-net src/main.ts

Then check: http://localhost:4242
